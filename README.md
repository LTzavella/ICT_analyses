## Analyses scripts for ICT study linked with OSF page https://osf.io/5f9b2/ 

* All data are available at https://osf.io/9cu64/ due to GDPR constraints.
* All files can be downloaded from the github or OSF page to create an RProject directory.
* The raw_data.zip file can be downloaded and extracted in the 'data' folder of the RProject directory.
* Due to the complexity of the data pre-processing pipeline, I have uploaded two other zip files on OSF for convenience:
    1. processed_raw_data.zip -> processed trial-level data from all participants ready for model comparisons (if these are manually loaded the LMM analyses can be performed directly)
    2. processed_data_JASP.zip -> processed data that have been aggregated and are ready for analyses in JASP
    
* More details about the data can be found on the wiki of the OSF page.
